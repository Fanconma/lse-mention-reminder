# lse-mention-reminder
A Mention Reminder plugin for LSE. While other players(or yourself) mentions you in game using the character `@`, you will recieve a toast popup(message) telling you someone just mentioned you.

You can mention a specific individual, or mention all players in the server using `@here`. 

It has a cooldown system so you can only mention once in 5 seconds, if you attempt to mention someone more than once in 5 seconds, the person you mentioned will only recieve one toast popup, but they can see your mention messages in the chat.


**NOTE**: Considering the majority of the target groups are Chinese speakers, the plugin has been hard-coded in Chinese. If you wanna change it to other languages, feel free to edit it yourself!
Having fun! :)
