# lse-mention-reminder
A Mention Reminder plugin for LSE. While other players(or yourself) mentions you in game using the character `@`, you will recieve a toast popup(message) telling you someone just mentioned you.

You can mention a specific individual, or mention all players in the server using `@here`. 

It has a cooldown system so you can only mention once in 5 seconds, if you attempt to mention someone more than once in 5 seconds, the person you mentioned will only recieve one toast popup, but they can see your mention messages in the chat.


**NOTE**: Considering the majority of the target groups are Chinese speakers, the plugin has been hard-coded in Chinese. If you wanna change it to other languages, feel free to edit it yourself!
Having fun! :)

# lse-mention-reminder
LSE 的提及提醒插件。当其他玩家（或您自己）使用字符“@”在游戏中提及您时，您将收到一个提示弹窗（消息），告诉您有人刚刚提及了您。

您可以提及特定的个人，也可以使用“@here”提及服务器中的所有玩家。

它有一个冷却系统，因此您只能在 5 秒内提及一次，如果您尝试在 5 秒内多次提及某人，您提及的人将只会收到一个提示弹窗，但他们可以在聊天中看到您的提及消息。

玩得开心！:)
